## Setup Guide

Welcome to the setup guide for the "Retrieve Me" project, a Flutter and Firebase-based application developed using Agile methodologies. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. **Git**: Version control system for cloning the project repository.
2. **Flutter**: SDK for building native applications using the Dart programming language.
3. **Firebase Account**: Access to Firebase console for project configuration.
4. **Android Studio** or **VS Code**: Integrated development environment (IDE) for Flutter development.
5. **Android/iOS Emulator** or a physical device for testing.

### Step-by-Step Setup Process

Follow these steps to set up the "Retrieve Me" project on your local machine:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and execute the following command to clone the project repository:

### Contributing and Agile Workflow

If you're interested in contributing to the project, we follow an Agile development workflow 
using Git. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix, make your changes, and submit a pull 
request to the `development` branch.

For Agile-related tasks, we use tools like Trello to manage user stories, tasks, and sprints. Feel free to join our Agile boards and participate in the development process.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the "Retrieve Me" project on your local machine using Agile development practices. You can now start developing, testing, and contributing to the project.

### Some important things to mention:
1. May be this code won't run on your PC because we removed some security files from here which are important and crucial for running this project.
